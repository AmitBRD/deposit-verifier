# deposit-contract-verifying-proxy
A smart contract to enhance the user experience of the `eth2` deposit contract

# NOTICE

This smart contract has not been tested, audited or formally verified. It should
be considered pre-alpha. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

# TODO

Add some basic unit tests.
Consider getting an audit.
Consider getting help w/ formal verification.
Make a nice frontend or integrate w/ the existing deposit contract stuff. Would
be nice to test on Goerli as soon as the unit tests suggest it is ready.
